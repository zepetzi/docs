## Buildspace -  S5 (2024)

This year, I also participated in [Buildspace's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-zkZWH3hho), 6 week program that combines elements of a mini-accelerator and hackathon. 
Alongside thousands of others, participants gain tools to build and refine their idea, get feedback, and learn what it means to build.
It was a great experience!
