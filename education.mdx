## Buildspace -  S5 (2024)

This year I also participated in an idea-school called [Buildspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hmBnU1I1Ew), a mix between a mini-accelerator and hackathon, 
where you spend 6 weeks gaining tools to build and refining your idea, get feedback, and learning what it means to build, amongst thousands of others.
It was a great experience!
