I'm really into cooking, playing games, and watching shows, but I also love to go outdoors, travel, and spend time with people!

I'm also a huge nerd for science and technology, and am passionate about art, design, and aesthetics. 

I currently have salt and pepper wings marinating in the fridge, I just finished watching Tower of God, and I'm currently playing the Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.
